A function is a named block of code. 
That code is logically related towards the execution of a specific task. 
A function should execute only one task.
A function should do what it's name says.
Functions are executed when they are invoked. 
The parameters are the variables that will hold the values that 
will be passed when the function is invoked
The values that will be passed to the parameters are called arguments

Using functions allows us to split an entire problem into sub-problems. This makes the code
more understandable when we read it. It also makes it reusable, which means that there would
be less amount of code, and also that if we have a certain logic at only one place, but not into
multiple places, we would be having to fix the code only at the single place. 


In the callstack the execution contexts are stored. 
One function calls another function, calls another function...
Until the function returns, it's execution context stays in the callstack.

I n JS a function itself is a value. It can be assigned as a value to a variable.
A function is kept as a reference data type in memory - in the Heap.
So the variable holds a reference to the place where the function is stored in memory.

A parameter is a variable in the scope of a function. When we exit the scope of the function
that variable stops existing.

A function consists of a name, parameters and body.
The default return value of  a function is undefined.

Only function declarations can be hoisted. The rest of the function types are being declared only
after the interpreter reads the row where they are declared and defined. 
This is because function declaration is a statement. 

First class is a specific feature of functions in JS. This means that functions are values.
It can be passed as an argument to another function, it can be returned as a result from 
another function and it can be assigned as a value to a variable.
