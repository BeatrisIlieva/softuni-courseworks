A class is an abstract definition of a certain object in general.
When we think of a cat for example, we do not think of a concrete cat 
but what a cat generally is. 
A concrete cat is an instance of that class. 

In a class are defined to common characteristics that a certain object has. 
Classes are a template or a fabric for creating objects that have one and the same shape(
    same properties, same methods
). 

Classes give us the advantage to create multiple objects that have one and 
the same characteristics without repeating code.

Function hoisting -> functions are first declared then the code is executed.
Classes are not being hoisted ->  we cannot create an instance of a class before it is declared. 

A class defines two things - properties(characteristics) and behavior (methods)

when we work though the instance of a class we can access the instance methods 
but we cannot access the static methods

when we work through the class we can access the static methods 
but we cannot access the instance methods 

Math.floor() -> example of a static method that we access through the type Math

A static method is a method of the class
An instance method is a method of the instance
