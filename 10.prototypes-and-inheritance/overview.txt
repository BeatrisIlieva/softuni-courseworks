const obj = {
    the entire row is a property
    property-name property-value

    name:         'Peter'
}

Every object has four properties:
1. Enumerable -> can be iterated with for ... in (enumerable properties are returned by OBject.keys)
2. Configurable -> modify behavior (we can only delete configurable properties)
3. Writable -> modify values (assign a new value)
4. Value

Once we define a property as non-configurable, the only behavior we can change is to set 
writable to 'false'
