Transpile VS Compile

`Transpile` converts code into another language such as JavaScript. `Compile` converts code into machine code. 

Before code is transpiled to JavaScript, the TypeScript compiler checks the code. Thus, if any errors they are caught before runtime. 

With `Type Assertion` we say to Typescript that we assert the variables is of a given type.
